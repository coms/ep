/**
* Passcode derivation
*  Problem 79
* A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user 
* for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, 
* they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.
* 
* The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.
* 
* Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, 
* analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.
